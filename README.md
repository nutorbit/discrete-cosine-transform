# Discrete Cosine Transform & Applications

An implementation of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) from scratch 
and some application such as image compression using JPEG algorithm. 

## Setup

I used [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage my work environment.

```zsh
$ poetry install
$ poetry run jupyter notebook
```

## TODO

* [x] Implement ZigZag
* [ ] Speed up DCT by using parallel or vectorization
* [ ] Implement Huffman Coding
